# RPGXchange v0.2.0

RPGXchange (RPGX) is an open specification for a versatile data interchange format designed to bridge the gap between various tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) platforms, tools, and applications. This format enables seamless transfer of character data, game content, and resources across virtual tabletops (VTTs), character managers, digital assistants, and other gaming platforms.
