# Introduction to RPGXchange

RPGXchange (RPGX) is an open specification for a versatile data interchange format designed to bridge the gap between various tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) platforms, tools, and applications. This format enables seamless transfer of character data, game content, and resources across virtual tabletops (VTTs), character managers, digital assistants, and other gaming platforms.

## Why RPGXchange?

The TTRPG community has experienced tremendous growth in digital tools and platforms, each offering unique features and capabilities. However, this diversity has led to fragmentation, making it challenging for players and game masters to move their content between different platforms or use multiple tools together effectively.

RPGXchange addresses these challenges by providing:

- A standardized way to represent game data across different systems and platforms
- Flexible design that accommodates various TTRPG rulesets, including homebrew content
- Platform-agnostic approach that allows tools to implement features based on their capabilities
- Extensible framework that can grow with the evolving needs of the community

## Core Design Philosophy

RPGXchange is built on several key principles:

1. **Interoperability**: Enable seamless data exchange between different platforms and tools
2. **Flexibility**: Support various game systems and house rules without compromising functionality
3. **Extensibility**: Allow for growth and adaptation as new technologies and needs emerge
4. **Simplicity**: Maintain an approachable design that developers can easily implement
5. **Community-Driven**: Evolve based on the needs and feedback of the TTRPG community

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of RPGXchange are to:

- Reduce the effort required to transfer character and game data between platforms
- Enable developers to create tools that work across multiple gaming platforms
- Support the preservation of character and campaign data independent of any specific platform
- Foster innovation in the TTRPG digital tools space
- Create a foundation for better integration between gaming tools and platforms
